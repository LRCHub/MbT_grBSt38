She knows how pathetic it looks
She's read it in books
And seen it in strangers
Eyes on the fickle spring sky
Awaiting the morning
Everything changes

Unsure what to hope for
When it does

What the hell happened last night?
Their first ever fight
And those far-away sirens
She sighed to herself, "for fuck's sake"
Lying awake in what passes for silence

Matching her breathing to his
What she's wondering is
How did they come to this?
How did they come to this
How did they come to this
