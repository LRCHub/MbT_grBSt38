Silence
Silence
Silence

Like dirty work in a dirty mine
In the sight of the woods where the hope is dying
I gave away what I was desprerate to lose
I only wish I had the power to choose
I saw the joy when I was dreaming I know
Under all the buses I was already thrown
The happiness is last next to places they thrive
The living death and I'm barely alive
If this was you I would save you here
But this was me I cower in fear
Oh stop this lying mind
Oh stop this dying mind

Hold me up and hold me down
Late at night I fall around
Underneath the spinning trees
Oblivion like grace to me
I was silent like a child
I was lost and roaming wild
We were just a million children crying out so quietly

I called you out and an ancient fate
Walk over bones in a laundromat
Holding onto ghosts as a portion of war
I'm seeing, and I'm waking and I'm propping them up
Echoing the love for a machine of war
Dying in the tremors of the home anymore
I want to walk into a night where I was open to care
I would've walked forever just to wake up there
But I fell flat can't imagine it now
Pushed to the limit of a living was there
I can't push myself, through
I couldn't believe, I couldn't believe it's gone

Hold me up and hold me down
Late at night I fall around
Underneath the spinning trees
Oblivion like grace to me
I was silent like a child
I was lost and roaming wild
We were just a million children crying out so quietly

And I was never shown the confident way
And I was never shown the confident way
And I was never shown the confident way
And I was never shown the confident way
And I was never shown the confident way
Crying out so quietly
