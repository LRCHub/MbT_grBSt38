Light broom drown in the dark
The man stole from the sky
The clock started counting the s
teps of the man world history
From zero to one
Flowing time goes, never come to
stop
伝えたい言葉をいくら叫んだって
From zero to one
Hear counting down to disaster?
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
To let the time go back
Go back Robbing every living lif
e
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
To let the world go back
Go back To collect the future's
piece
Now look in to yourself
Stand face-to-face
Wake up to get out from the plac
e
you have hid yourself
From zero to one
I hated powerless me
To jump over this world
流される想いをいくら掴んだって
The clock runs too fast
I lost the world again
We are so, lonelier than we thin
k,
but you can't keep
Yourself when you give up,
So we keep fighting
Our feeling itself make the view
Feeling make view to the world
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
To let the time go back
Go back Robbing every living lif
e
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
To let the world go back
Go back To collect the future's
piece
Don't want to make up
That's not the right answer
Don't want to make up
In such a world we live
I have a will here
In my heart
Time doesn't solve this fake
Don't want to make up
That's not the right answer
Don't want to make up
In such a world we live
I have a will here
In my heart
Time doesn't solve this fake
Can you still dance?
Burn until you become into ash
That's the place you chose
That's the place you chose
Can you still dance?
Stop, and you lose everything
That feeling you've felt
That feeling you've felt
Now give me what you have
There's nothing you're afraid of
That's the place you chose
That's the place you chose
Now give me what you have
if you have your precious
That feeling you've felt
That feeling you've felt
Now it's time
Asks to all
Every living life
Limited life
Opening of the new age
Asks to all
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
To let the time go back
Go back Robbing every living lif
e
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
When the silence and fire throug
h the night
To let the world go back
Go back To collect the future's
piece
This world maybe a bit too diffi
cult
It may make us all alone
Since the day we receive the pow
er
Grant everything in the time tha
t goes too fast
Then the silence and fire throug
h the night
Then the silence and fire throug
h the night
